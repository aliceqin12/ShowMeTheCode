Mattie Stepanek is wheeling around his living room like any 11-year-old boy on an electric scooter. But Mattie's "scooter" is his life station - an electric wheelchair. He suffers from a rare form of muscular dystrophy, a ventilator supplying his oxygen. Mattie, wise beyond his years1, has become the newest rage in the publishing world with his tiny volume of inspiring poems, Heartsongs, and its sequel, Journey Through Heartsongs.
"I'm a bit surprised," Mattie says. "I never thought my message would get out so quickly." He is a poet who calls himself a peacemaker.
Mattie's life has been filled with surprises - good and bad. He has almost died more than once, was named the National Goodwill Ambassador for the Muscular Dystrophy Association.2 A precocious child who has already studied at a local community college, his goal is to major in peace studies and writing.3 "He lives on the edge. It could be one day or one year," his mother says. Three of Mattie's siblings already have died of the disease. "We've been given the gift of time. He's spending these days living, not dying." Meanwhile, Mattie continues what he calls his "peace work," with a possible speaking tour in the works. "We need to win the war on terrorism with words, not bombs," he says. "We need to sit down and listen to our heartsongs. We need to stop fighting over things that don't matter, things like land and money," Mattie says.
He has already become a pro at the celebrity game, taking interviews into his own hands.
